Welcome to my **Java DSA Repository** 📦  
This repo contains all the **Data Structures and Algorithms** I learn during my DSA journey — each topic has examples, **best case** & **worst case** scenarios, and code written in **Java**.

---

## 💡 Example: Best & Worst Case

### 📌 Example: Linear Search
**Scenario:** Searching an element in an array of `n` elements.

**Best Case (O(1)):**
- Element is found at the **first position**.
```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int key = 10; // First element
// Found immediately → O(1)
```

**Worst Case (O(n)):**
- Element is found at the **last position** or not present at all.
```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int key = 50; // Not found
// Need to check all → O(n)
```
